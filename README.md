# hello Odin
# hello-world
a repository I create when I learned Odin Project
This is the first  github project I create,
This is also a starting point I code, I will keep on whaterve I encounter the problem.AI will eat the world.Everyone should learn how to code.
I made a mistake in the sentence above ,so I correct the sentence that will be " I will keep going on whatever I encounter any problems"
